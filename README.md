# PanelHawk: Detect individual comic panels for reading and capturing
Copyright (c) 2018 Colin McCoy

This program reads compressed comic book files in the popular .cbr and .cbz formats. In addition to the usual page-by-page
reading style, PanelHawk will detect panels within the pages, and allow the user to zoom in on these panels or capture 
individual screenshots of them.
